# CT Dose OCR

This is a C# program for converting graphical CT dose screens to text. Assumes lossless images and implements optical character recognition (OCR) through exact glyph matching.

Includes font sets for Siemens, Toshiba, Philips, and GE scanners.

This project now uses the [DotNetZip Library](http://dotnetzip.codeplex.com) for extracting font character bitmaps.

Requires .NET Framework 2.0 or higher.
